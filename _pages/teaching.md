# Personalised Tutoring

After several enquiries and referrals about tutoring from colleagues, friends and family, I have decided to add this page to offer my services to those who are interested in learning more about data science, programming, statistics, mathematics, or even just setting up their own website.

I see personalised tutoring as an alternative to self-study and formal education. Both have deficiencies: self-study from either books or bootcamp courses can be slow, inefficient and lacking in tailored guidance, while formal education can be expensive, rigid, and often out of date. In contrast, personalised tutoring from a practitioner offers several benefits: it is relevant, efficient, flexible, cost-effective, and customised to your goals.

# My Background
I have extensive experience in these areas and a history of exceptional academic achievement, achieving top grades even in the most challenging subjects such as statistical machine learning, Bayesian analysis, statistical network analysis, and multivariate analysis. 

In my work as a data scientist, I have designed and implemented machine learning models, conducted exploratory data analysis, and developed data visualisations. My work in detection scenario tuning in particular has been praised by external consultants as among the most sophisticated implementation they have seen among European banks.

If you are interested in learning more about my educational and professional background, please visit my [about page](/about), read my [CV](/cv_page), or check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/enda-flynn-80a465174). 

## Topics

Below is an indicative table of topics that I can help you with. I can provide tutoring in any of these areas, from beginner to advanced levels. I can also provide tutoring in many related areas not listed here, so please feel free to ask if you have a specific topic in mind.

# Previous Experience in Tutoring
I have tutored several family, friends, and colleagues in the past and, to my surprise, I found that I really enjoyed it. 

Some of my previous students were individuals struggling with statistics and mathematics in their graduate courses, software engineers upskilling for data science projects, individuals looking to transition from operational roles into data science by learning to code, and even an experienced weather forecaster looking to apply Bayesian analysis to their work.

# How to Get Started
If you are interested in personalised tutoring, please feel free to contact me at my socials which you can find on my [about page](/about). I'm happy to provide a consultation to discuss your needs and answer any questions you may have. 

To allow me to better understand your needs, please provide me with a brief description of your background, your goals, and the topics you are interested in learning. I will then get back to you as soon as possible with a proposal for how we can work together to achieve your goals.
