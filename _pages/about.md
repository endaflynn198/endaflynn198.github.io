Hello! Iâ€™m Enda Flynn, a Data Scientist at AIB, where I designed and now lead the Detection Scenario Tuning workstream within the Group Financial Crime Compliance division where my focus is on leveraging robust EDA, machine learning, and explainable AI to enhance transaction monitoring systems. Prior to leading this workstream, I played a central role in defining both the Data Quality and Detection Scenario Development workstreams.

My work at AIB has led to significant enhancements in Data Quality by introducing monitoring tools to track transactions which fail to load into the NetReveal database and co-developing the process to remediate these. In Detection Scenario Development I have automated numerous manual SQL scenarios through a large, modular Python program which extended alert functionality and set new standards in alert verification, volume monitoring, and robust version control in the process. My role also extends to pioneering advancements in reporting and visualization, ensuring accuracy, actionable insights, and sustained increases in MI quality.

Beyond my professional role, I am a developer of innovative solutions and tools as varied as a library for imputation experiments, an e-reader annotation converter, and web scrapers, as demonstrated in my array of personal projects hosted on my GitHub. It is largely my personal study of new libraries and these projects which has enabled my innovations in my work.

In addition to the above, I have a strong background in mathematics and statistics with a history of exceptional academic achievement.

I am currently in the process of building out my GitHub portfolio and this website to more fully showcase my work and abilities, so feel free to send me a request to connect on LinkedIn or contact me if you have any questions.
