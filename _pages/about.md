Hello! I'm Enda Flynn, a Data Scientist at AIB, leading projects within the Group Financial Crime Compliance division focused on leveraging machine learning and AI to enhance fraud detection systems. Beyond my professional role, I am an avid developer of innovative solutions and tools that address complex challenges, as demonstrated in my array of personal projects hosted on my GitHub.

My work at AIB has led to significant enhancements in data quality, automating 24 manual scenarios through a comprehensive Python program, while setting new standards in transaction verification and compliance monitoring in the process. My role extends to pioneering advancements in data processing and visualization, ensuring accuracy and actionable insights.

In addition to my work, I engage deeply in personal projects - some of which you can find here on my GitHub.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
