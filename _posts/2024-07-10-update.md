# Website Update
As I've been updating this website in my downtime, things have been moving slowly but surely. The last while I've added / changed the following:

1. Updated the home page to include a brief bio
2. Updated the CV page and added a link to a (mostly) updated PDF version
3. Added my two GitHub repositories 
4. Removed the template news items

There's still a lot to do, but I'm happy with the progress so far and I'm looking forward to adding more content and features in the future. Some of these will take a bit more work - adding more of my projects to GitHub and presenting this in the projects tab, for example - but it's all part of the fun in learning how to use Jekyll and GitHub Pages.

I'm also looking forward to adding substantive blog posts over the next while (and removing the template blog posts). I've been working on a few projects in my spare time that I'm excited to share, so stay tuned for that.

Within the next few weeks (or months) I'll have a more polished website to show off. Until then, thanks for stopping by!
