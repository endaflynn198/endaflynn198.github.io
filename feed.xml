While I’ve been using R extensively for a while (almost a decade…), I’ve only built packages in Python before.</p> <p>At the beginning of the process, I was frustrated with some of the quirks of R package building. However, with a bit more experience, I’ve come to see the benefits of helpers like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">devtools</code>,<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">usethis</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">roxygen2</code>.</p> <p>Maybe in future I’ll write a post on how to build an R package from scratch. But for now, I’ve provided <a href="#resources">Resources</a> below which I found useful.</p> <h2 id="the-data---hdi-indicators">The Data - HDI Indicators</h2> <p>The UN Human Development Indicators dataset encompasses a broad range of data that reflect the multi-dimensional aspects of human development across countries. These indicators offer insights into the health, education levels, and economic status of different populations, providing a comprehensive understanding of global human development trends.</p> <p>You can find the data <a href="https://data.humdata.org/dataset/?organization=undp-human-development-reports-office&amp;q=Human+Development+Indicators">here</a>.</p> <h2 id="the-package">The Package</h2> <p>The package I’ve built is designed to allow the easy summary and comparison of UN Human Development Indicators data.</p> <p>While it’s somewhat basic (as it’s more of a learning exercise), it does offer some useful functions for summarising and comparing the data between different countries. And, of course, being an R package it can be easily extended to include more functionality in future.</p> <p>You can install it from GitHub using the following code:</p> <div class="language-r highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">devtools</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">install_github</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"endaflynn198/HDI_summary"</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="n">library</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">HDIsummary</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div> <p>And you can get a sense of the package by reading the vignette comparing Singapore and Nigeria <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/endaflynn198/HDI_summary/blob/main/vignettes/HDIsummary.html">here</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>Note that the above link makes use of GitHub’s HTML previewer which you can find <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/">here</a>. I highly recommend it for sharing HTML files in your GitHub repositories as GitHub doesn’t render them directly.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="resources">Resources</h2> <p>If you’re interested in learning more about building R packages, I recommend the following resources:</p> <ol> <li><a href="https://r-pkgs.org/">R Packages by Hadley Wickham and Jennifer Bryan</a></li> <li><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/package-development.pdf">RStudio’s Package Development Cheat Sheet</a></li> </ol> <h2 id="soundtrack">Soundtrack</h2> <p>While building this package I’ve been listening to a lot of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0N0QVRWWt6g">The Four Freshmen</a> - a harmonic highlight of an old favourite is at 3.10 of the linked video. Soothing when you’re trying to figure out why your package isn’t building properly or restarting your R session for the 10th time…</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="code"/><category term="r"/><category term="package"/><category term="update"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new R package for analysing UN Human Development Indicators]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Website Update</title><link href="https://endaflynn198.github.io/blog/2024/update/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Website Update"/><published>2024-07-10T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://endaflynn198.github.io/blog/2024/update</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://endaflynn198.github.io/blog/2024/update/"><![CDATA[<h1 id="website-update">Website Update</h1> <p>As I’ve been updating this website in my downtime, things have been moving slowly but surely. The last while I’ve added / changed the following:</p> <ol> <li>Updated the home page to include a brief bio</li> <li>Updated the CV page and added a link to a (mostly) updated PDF version</li> <li>Added my two GitHub repositories</li> <li>Removed the template news items</li> </ol> <p>There’s still a lot to do, but I’m happy with the progress so far and I’m looking forward to adding more content and features in the future. Some of these will take a bit more work - adding more of my projects to GitHub and presenting this in the projects tab, for example - but it’s all part of the fun in learning how to use Jekyll and GitHub Pages.</p> <p>I’m also looking forward to adding substantive blog posts over the next while (and removing the template blog posts). I’ve been working on a few projects in my spare time that I’m excited to share, so stay tuned for that.</p> <p>Within the next few weeks (or months) I’ll have a more polished website to show off. Until then, thanks for stopping by!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="website-update"/><category term="update"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[an update on the website progress]]></summary></entry></feed>
